  (right mouse click on the connect button (Windows/Linux/Unix))
- Added FAT time workaround for all connections.

  on both connections concurrently.
- Added directory bookmark handling. A user can save his favorite directories
  and revisit them later quickly.

Bug fixes:

  slower.

  tree.

  to Ralf Hoffmann for his help.
- SSHTools: 0.2.9.1 fixes problems with UTF-8 encoded file names
- Collecting files for sync aborts when some file cannot get opened.
  Now the user can decide if he wants to add this restricted file to the
  exclude list. Synchronization of restricted directories is therefore also
  possible.
- When changing to a parent directory on a remote connection (SFTP/FTP)
  the child directory that we are coming from was not selected (Windows).

Version 0.7.3

General:
- Updated Chinese language pack (Joel)
- Updated Brazilian Portuguese language pack (Sergio Henrique)
- Replaced labels of synchronization dialogs by their locale representation.
- Deleted all deprected classes. Code cleanup.
- Massive speed improvement for constructing the synchronization tree.
  Before, the tree builder computed SHA-1 and MD5 hash sum for all files
  disregarding if files are already marked as unique. Now, it does only
  compute the hash code when a file is not unique and the corresponding file
  has the same file size.

Bug fixes:
- Skipping an existing file or directory will result in unprecise copy
  statistics.
- Copying a directory without having write permissions causes the copy thread
  to fail. The newly created directory is already given new permissions before
  files have been copied into. Subsequent attempts to append files will fail.
- When option "open a directory with a single mouse click" is enabled, the user
  is unable to select directories. Fixed. User can now hold down CTRL and click
  mouse button1 to select directories.
- LinkExistsDialog contains a method that is only available for JDK5. This method
  has been replaced in order to guarantee full Java 1.4.x compatibility.

  using remote connections, GNU plugin not available
- Added hotkeys: C+n rename file, F3 start viewer
- Added option: always exit without prompt when closing Capivara
- Change dialog containing saved favourites. Only favourites for remote
  connections may be saved.
- Added: Choosing a port for remote connections.
- Added GNU plugin which is a replacement for the local plugin on Linux machines.
  It works with any Unix like system that uses the GNU ls command.
  The plugin is based on GNU ls (list directory contents).
  So, the file informations such as name, size, permissions etc. are taken from
  the GNU ls output.
- Selection behavior of entries in file table changed. When a directory gets
  listed in another panel, the keyboard focus will stay in the currently active
  panel. (Nice small patch by Ralf Hoffmann)

Bug fixes:
- fixed: Storing a file on FTP servers damages the target file when target has same name.
- fixed: Infinite loop: Another connection with this name already exists

Version 0.7.1

General:
- Scrollbar behavior changed when changing to a parent directory which has
  more entries than the filetable can display.

Bug fixes:
- fixed: directory permissions are not preserved

Version 0.7.0

General:
- added new keystrokes (see the howtos)

- Copying from a remote directory to a remote target is now completely
  transparent to the user. Only accumulated statistics of both operations,
  put and get, will be shown.
- Complete rewrite of the file copy classes (+statistics).
  Copying and syncing share one code base now. As a result, the sync progress
  dialog can retrieve statistical data of files which are transferred.
- The user can now choose to delete incomplete files in case of IO errors.

Bug fixes:
- fixed: file copy option "preserve permissions if available" is not saved
- After the user has cancelled the file transfer, the user gains control
  when the copy thread finally exits.
- The local plugin throws IOException when a file cannot be deleted and
  exits. Now, a confirmation dialog will be prompted to continue deleting files.

  can now cancel the operation
- added new worker GUI model, GUI components now plug dynamically into the
  corresponding panel when a worker is executed

  DataCollectWorker in SyncTreeBuilder
