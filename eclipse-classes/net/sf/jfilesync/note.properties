<h1>A note from the developer</h1>

<p align="justify">
I would like to remind every user that this software has been coded, not because I have any financial interest, 
but because I needed a tool for a specific task of mine.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>MY main intend</strong> was to be able to synchronize a huge number of job files with several clusters over SFTP. 
Capivara perfectly does the job for me. So, I released the tool to the public. Some people liked it and found it useful though.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Please, keep that in mind when you judge Capivara. <strong>It's free</strong>, it's been released under the GPLv2. So, it's up to 
everyone to make changes. I wish that people would <strong>have more respect for open source software</strong> instead of complaining about it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In case you feel that you want to contribute, you can make changes to the code, contribute them back, or simply 
<strong>donate</strong> (at http://www.capivara.org).
</p>

<p align="justify">
Yours sincerely,<br/>
